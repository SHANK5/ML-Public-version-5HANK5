# Accident Detection Using Machine Learning

 - This project implements an accident detection system using a machine learning model trained on image data. The system can process video feeds or images to classify frames as either "Accident" or "Non-Accident."
 - Here I have uploaded the model in this repository.So enjoy!!
 - The accuracy of the model is around 82%.
 - Trained the model for 10 epochs.
 - The epochs are less since the higher number of epochs was leading to the  overfitting
 - The trained model is inside the folder saved_model.
