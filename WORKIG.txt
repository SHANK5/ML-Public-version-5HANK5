1. Collected data from YouTube and Kaggle.
2. Downloaded the required videos.
3. Extracted video frames and converted them into images.
4. Divided the data into training, validation, and test sets.
5. Selected a suitable model architecture.
6. Consulted online resources, including Google, official documentation, and Stack Overflow, to design the training script.
7. Developed the train.py script based on these references.
8. Modified various parameters in train.py to customize the model for specific needs.
9. Trained the model for 10 epochs.
10. Saved the trained model for future use.
11. Created the accident-detection.py script to evaluate the model's performance.
12. Tested accident-detection.py to confirm the model's functionality.
13. Developed an email-sending script to alert the authorities, initially using friendsâ€™ email addresses for testing.
14. Integrated the accident-detection.py and email-sending scripts.
15. Configured accident-detection.py to call the email-sending function.
16. Restricted the email alerts to a maximum of two per video.
17. Limited each email to include only 8 images extracted from the video.
18. Designed the system to automatically stop after completing its tasks per video.
